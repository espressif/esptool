# GitLab CI

Entry point: [`.gitlab-ci.yml`](../.gitlab-ci.yml). Jobs are split across this directory.

Also keep [`.github/workflows/test_esptool.yml`](../.github/workflows/test_esptool.yml) in sync when changing install or test steps.

## Pipelines

- **MR / branch push** — lint, install checks, tests, coverage report. Docs build/deploy when doc files change.
- **`internal/dev_release` push** — above plus preview package build (manual publish).
- **Nightly schedule** (`STUB_CANARY=1`) — stub canary only; see [Canary](#canary).

Push pipelines are skipped when an open MR already exists for the branch.

## Stages

```
pre-check → check → test → report
```

Optional: `build_docs` → `deploy_docs`, `deploy_development_package`.

Canary adds `canary_prep` before and `canary_post` after.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `danger.yml` | Danger MR linter (internal `shared-ci-dangerjs` include + its job override); skipped on `bot/sync-master` (see [Sync to internal](#sync-to-internal)) |
| `checks.yml` | Install smoke tests, stub freshness |
| `host_tests.yml` | Linux + Windows host pytest jobs |
| `target_tests.yml` | Hardware tests per board (`target_<chip>` jobs), Windows smoke on `COM4` |
| `canary.yml` | Nightly stub compatibility |
| `deploy_docs.yml` | Docs build and deploy |
| `internal_release.yml` | Internal preview sdist |
| `sync_to_internal.yml` | On each merge to `master`, open/refresh the review MR syncing `master` → `internal/dev_release` (see [Sync to internal](#sync-to-internal)) |

Python images: `PYTHON_IMAGE_MIN` and `PYTHON_IMAGE_LATEST` in `.gitlab-ci.yml`. Canary jobs use `CANARY_IMAGE` (`ubuntu:24.04`).

## What runs where

**pre-check** — Danger MR linter, pre-commit.

**check** — Package installs (`pip install` / `-e` / venv / `--user`), CLI `--help`, stub freshness, UF2 ID test.

**test** — Host tests (`pytest -m host_test` on Linux; `-m "host_test and not linux_host_test"` on Windows — tests marked `linux_host_test` are excluded; see `test/conftest.py`), espefuse matrix, hardware jobs in `target_tests.yml` (`-m "not host_test"` — host-only cases run in `host_tests` instead), Windows `quick_test` smoke on `COM4`.

**report** — `combine_reports` merges coverage from test jobs.

## Canary

Nightly job that builds fresh v2 stubs from **esp-stub-lib** and runs the full test suite against them. All canary jobs use `$CANARY_IMAGE` (`ubuntu:24.04`).

1. `canary_poll` — skip if SHA unchanged (cancels pipeline)
2. `canary_build_stubs` → `canary_patch` — build stubs, patch into tree
3. Normal test jobs (after `canary_prep` via stage order; patched stubs passed as artifacts)
4. `canary_record` — save SHA on success; `canary_on_failure` — open issue on failure

**Quiet nights:** if `LAST_TESTED_STUB_LIB_SHA` is unchanged, `canary_poll` cancels the pipeline before build/tests run. `canary_on_failure` does not run on cancel, so no spurious issues are opened.

**Attribution:** only esp-stub-lib is tracked across runs; esp-flasher-stub is rebuilt from master each night. Issue titles blame esp-stub-lib, but both SHAs appear in the issue body.

**CI variables:** `STUB_CANARY` (on the schedule, not project-wide), `LAST_TESTED_STUB_LIB_SHA` (auto-created by `canary_record`), `GITLAB_API_TOKEN` (api scope, Maintainer+ — cancel on quiet nights and record SHA), optional `MAINTAINERS`.

## Sync to internal

`open_sync_mr` (in `sync_to_internal.yml`) runs on every push to `master` — i.e. each MR merge. It keeps a single rolling review MR that brings `internal/dev_release` up to `master`:

- **Clean merge** — prepares the `master` → `internal/dev_release` merge on the unprotected `bot/sync-master` branch, then find-or-creates ONE MR into `internal/dev_release` with `$MAINTAINERS` as reviewers, and links it back on the just-merged `master` MR. A maintainer checks the MR's pipeline and merges it — the only write to `internal/dev_release`.
- **Conflict** — no MR is opened (it would only sit unmergeable); the bot comments on the original `master` MR naming the conflicting files with a bounded hunk preview and cc'ing `$MAINTAINERS`.

The bot never merges the sync MR or pushes to `internal/dev_release`. `bot/sync-master` stays unprotected so it never reaches the GitHub mirror. Logic lives in `ci/sync_to_internal.py`; `SYNC_DRY_RUN=1` logs the intended actions without performing them.

**Danger on the sync MR:** the `danger.yml` include is guarded by `include:rules` and skipped on `bot/sync-master`. That pipeline runs under the sync bot's project access token, which can't read the *internal* `shared-ci-dangerjs` project; resolving the cross-project include under it fails config compilation (`config_error`, 0 jobs). The include and its `run-danger-mr-linter` override live together in `danger.yml` so `include:rules` can skip both at once — guarding only the include would leave the override as a scriptless job (its `script` comes from the include), itself a `config_error`. The guard keys on `CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME` (the source branch on both push and merge-request pipelines, and one of the few variables allowed in `include:rules`). The trade-off is that the sync MR's pipeline no longer runs the Danger linter — acceptable, since it only mirrors already-reviewed `master` MRs.

**CI variables:** `GITLAB_API_TOKEN` (api scope; reuses the shared canary token, but every action here — API calls plus the push to the unprotected `bot/sync-master` — needs only the **Developer** role), optional `MAINTAINERS`, optional `SYNC_DRY_RUN`.

## Runners

- `host_test` — Linux Docker
- `esptool-*` — per-board hardware (see `target_tests.yml`)
- `windows-target` — Windows
- `dangerjs`, `build_docs`, `deploy` — specialised jobs
